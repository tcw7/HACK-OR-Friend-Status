# Friend Status

Do you and your friends, teammates, or co-workers use multiple team chat applications?
Have you ever wished that you could see their status in those multiple services so you could reach them more quickly wherever they are currently active?
Friend Status is a web application that shows their current status across three different team chat platforms:

- [Slack](https://slack.com/)
- [Discord](https://discord.com/)
- [Zulip](https://zulip.com/)

We used boilerplate from: https://github.com/realpython/flask-boilerplate

We also used some code snippets from the documentation of the respective technologies and services.

This was created by a beginner team for the [HackOR 2021 Hackathon](https://hackor.org/).
